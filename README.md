# push_swap_Kotlin
I started learning Kotlin, I thought it's a good idea to get familiar with the syntax and features of the language by rewriting my favorite 42 project in it.

### [**Documented C version**](https://github.com/AshParker19/42_push_swap)

### Concepts I've learned
* data classes
* constant objects
* primary constructors
* init blocks
* require() function
* `when` statement
* `in` operator
* extension functions
* scope functions - `let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, `also`
* repeat() function
* imitation of `C` call by reference by using mutable objects
* `return if` syntax
* multiple of lambda expressions: `map`, `forEach`, `forEachInexed`, `firstOrNull`, `filter`, `indexOfFirst`, `indexOfLast`, `sumOf`, `coerceAtLeast` and some more
